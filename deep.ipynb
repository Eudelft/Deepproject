    "The goal of this blog is to reproduce the paper [Driver Identification Based on Vehicle Telematics Data using LSTM-Recurrent Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08030). This paper uses vehicle telematics data (OBD-II) with machine learning tools to classify the driving style of a driver. The proposed model is a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTMs), this is an RNN architectures variant. For this reproduction, our group is assigned to reproduce Figures 9 & 10. These figures compare the accuracy of LTSMs against FCNN, Decision tree, and Random Forest models by inducing increasing levels of noise on the test data. We have chosen to do a mix of reproducing a small portion of the code and using some of the criteria given on Brightspace."

    "First look at the code it seems a bit messy, with multiple imports and multiple functions defined throughout the code. When running the code we seem to have trouble with X_test_5. Also, the author of the paper mentioned the code could have some issues because it was developed in a different setting."
