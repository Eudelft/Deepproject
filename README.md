# Reproducing "Driver Identiﬁcation Based on Vehicle Telematics Data using LSTM-Recurrent Neural Network"

Hi there, and thank you for reading our code! This repo is connected with our blog https://hackmd.io/@cD4Efh4gQ3euxDXtpaE-uQ/HkLxPBnm5.

We suggest you to use both to find your way :)
\
Main notebook: Reproduction.ipynb \

Best model : best_model (folder, can be loaded using Keras) \

HP search : hp_models (we wrote a custom loop to extract the necessary data. There must be a cleaner way to do it) \

functions : the original authors combined exectutable code and function definitions in the script. We basically only put their functions in the main_function.py file.
