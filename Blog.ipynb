This paper uses vehicle telematics data (OBD-II) with machine learning tools to classify the driving style of a driver. The proposed model is a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTMs), this is an RNN architectures variant. For this reproduction, our group is assigned to reproduce Figures 9 & 10. These figures compare the accuracy of LTSMs against FCNN, Decision tree, and Random Forest models by inducing increasing levels of noise on the test data.
